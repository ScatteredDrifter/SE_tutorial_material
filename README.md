belongs to [191.00]
>This is a convolution of information, slides, notes regarding my "Software Engineering" tutorial 

## Overview:
This repository acts as anchor for the students attending my **se_tutorial** in **WiSe2023/24**.

## Motivation:
Because this course aims to teach and learn with Git, its likely beneficial to incorporate the usage of git and GitHub to provide and share those files.

This repository will hopefully develop over time and maybe contain some information that may be hidden ( tbh I'm not good with riddles so dunno if its gonna be difficult at all or so )
